Automated Testing for GUI Application using Cucumber (Behave)
This project contains automated test cases for a GUI application (basic_maths_gui.py) using the Cucumber test framework with Behave.

Prerequisites
Python 3.11
Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
Setup
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Running Tests
To run the automated tests, execute the following command:

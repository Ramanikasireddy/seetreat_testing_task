# Simple Maths + GUI

## set up

- Tested using python 3.11
- to install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (advisable to use a new virtual environment)

## test task

This code consists of two modules:

1. `basic_maths`: an extremely stupid implementation of a some basic maths functions.
2. `basic_maths_gui`: a basic QT GUI that uses `basic_maths` as the backend.

you have two tasks:

1. Write some test cases for `basic_maths.py`. These tests should be scripted - pytest would be a good tool but you can do whatever you want!
2. Write some test cases for `basic_maths_gui.py`. These tests could be manually executed, but should be written using an established test framework such as cucumber

Please fork this repository to a **private** branch, include the test cases there, and add me as a colloborator so i can review.
